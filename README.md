Key steps
1. Understanding literature
2. Finalise title

Existing method: 
* State of the art - Model agnostic meta-learning, semi-supervised methods (e.g. fix match)
* Older methods - Siamese network, prototype networks

Most common datasets:
* Usually - Binary classification
* Previous work - Multi-class classification
* Thoughts: could train on binary classification, then do transfer learning to train on previous dataset

Task:
* Previous dataset - glautoma detection
* Reading new papers might mean we identify new task

State-of-the-art method:
* Model agnostic meta-learning (few-shot learning)
* Semi-supervised methods
* Q: HOW STATE OF THE ART ARE THESE?
* Q: Too easy, perfect, too difficult?

Metrics (improve performance of):
* To be discussed later.

Responsibilities (for now):
1. (A) Understanding review papers: all read
2. (B) Understanding research papers: divide responsibilities
